# ðŸŽ® Dynamic Rules: Evolving Game Concept

## Core Concept: The Rules Change You

The fundamental innovation of "Man vs God" is that **the rules themselves are dynamic and evolve based on collective player behavior**. This creates a meta-game where players don't just play within rules, but actively shape the rules through their strategic and moral choices.

## ðŸ§¬ Rule Evolution System

### **Phase 1: Rule Discovery**
- Players encounter rules that seem fixed
- They make strategic and moral choices
- Their decisions are recorded and analyzed

### **Phase 2: Pattern Recognition**
- The system identifies emerging patterns in player behavior
- Common strategies and moral preferences are detected
- Rule-breaking or innovative approaches are flagged

### **Phase 3: Rule Mutation**
- Based on collective behavior, rules begin to shift
- New rule variations emerge
- Old rules become obsolete or modified

### **Phase 4: Rule Stabilization**
- Successful rule mutations become permanent
- Failed mutations are discarded
- The game evolves to reflect player preferences

## ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Rule Categories

### **1. Betting Rules Evolution**
- **Initial Rule**: Fixed betting amounts
- **Evolution**: Betting amounts adjust based on success rates
- **Player Influence**: High-risk players â†’ Higher betting limits
- **Collective Impact**: Conservative players â†’ Lower minimum bets

### **2. Moral Weight Evolution**
- **Initial Rule**: Fixed moral weights for pieces
- **Evolution**: Moral weights change based on player choices
- **Player Influence**: Pieces frequently spared â†’ Higher moral weight
- **Collective Impact**: Pieces frequently captured â†’ Lower moral weight

### **3. God's Authority Evolution**
- **Initial Rule**: God's suggestions are binding if bet is higher
- **Evolution**: God's authority level changes based on success rate
- **Player Influence**: Players frequently disobey â†’ God becomes more lenient
- **Collective Impact**: Players follow God â†’ God becomes more authoritative

### **4. Scoring System Evolution**
- **Initial Rule**: Fixed scoring formula
- **Evolution**: Scoring weights adjust based on player preferences
- **Player Influence**: Strategic players â†’ Higher strategic score weight
- **Collective Impact**: Moral players â†’ Higher moral score weight

### **5. Piece Behavior Evolution**
- **Initial Rule**: Fixed piece backstories and consequences
- **Evolution**: Character development based on player interactions
- **Player Influence**: Characters frequently spared â†’ Develop positive traits
- **Collective Impact**: Characters frequently captured â†’ Develop negative traits

## ðŸ”„ Implementation Strategy

### **Data Collection Points**
1. **Player Decisions**: Every choice is recorded with context
2. **Success Patterns**: Which strategies lead to better outcomes
3. **Moral Trends**: How moral choices affect long-term success
4. **Rule Effectiveness**: Which rules create better gameplay

### **Evolution Triggers**
- **Threshold-Based**: When 70% of players adopt a new strategy
- **Time-Based**: Weekly rule evolution cycles
- **Performance-Based**: Rules that improve player satisfaction
- **Innovation-Based**: Novel approaches that gain traction

### **Rule Mutation Types**
- **Addition**: New rules emerge from player behavior
- **Modification**: Existing rules adjust to player preferences
- **Removal**: Unused or unpopular rules are eliminated
- **Recombination**: Rules combine to form new mechanics

## ðŸŽ­ Player Agency in Rule Creation

### **Direct Influence**
- **Voting System**: Players can vote on rule changes
- **Proposal System**: Players can propose new rules
- **Testing System**: Players can test experimental rules

### **Indirect Influence**
- **Behavioral Patterns**: How players naturally play shapes rules
- **Success Metrics**: What works becomes the new standard
- **Social Dynamics**: Player interactions create new rule needs

### **Emergent Rules**
- **Unintended Consequences**: Player actions create unexpected rule needs
- **Meta-Strategies**: Players develop strategies around rule manipulation
- **Community Standards**: Collective behavior establishes new norms

## ðŸ“Š Rule Evolution Tracking

### **Rule Lifecycle**
1. **Birth**: Rule emerges from player behavior
2. **Testing**: Rule is tested with subset of players
3. **Adoption**: Rule becomes standard if successful
4. **Maturation**: Rule stabilizes and becomes predictable
5. **Evolution**: Rule adapts to new player behaviors
6. **Death**: Rule becomes obsolete and is removed

### **Success Metrics**
- **Player Engagement**: How much players interact with the rule
- **Strategic Depth**: How much the rule adds to gameplay
- **Moral Complexity**: How much the rule enhances moral choices
- **Community Satisfaction**: How well the rule is received

## ðŸŽ® Game Experience Evolution

### **Early Game (Weeks 1-4)**
- Players discover basic rules
- Simple strategic and moral choices
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships

### **Mid Game (Weeks 5-12)**
- Rules begin to shift based on player behavior
- Players notice changes and adapt strategies
- Emergence of meta-strategies

### **Late Game (Weeks 13+)**
- Rules are highly personalized to player community
- Complex interactions between evolved rules
- Players actively shape the game experience

## ðŸ”® Future Possibilities

### **AI-Driven Evolution**
- Machine learning algorithms predict rule changes
- Personalized rule sets for different player types
- Adaptive difficulty based on player skill

### **Community Governance**
- Democratic voting on major rule changes
- Player councils for rule development
- Community-driven rule creation

### **Cross-Game Evolution**
- Rules evolve across multiple game instances
- Global rule sharing between communities
- Emergence of universal gaming principles
