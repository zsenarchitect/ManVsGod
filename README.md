## Concept
A progressive social experiment where players face escalating moral dilemmas while battling against the collective memory of all previous players. Each level gets harder and more hazardous, testing your moral limits as you fight against the "God" of collective human wisdom.

## Core Mechanics
- **Progressive Difficulty**: 5 levels of escalating moral challenges from Easy to Impossible
- **Individual vs Collective**: You make decisions as an individual, but face the consequences of collective human behavior
- **Dynamic Probabilities**: Past player choices shift the likelihood of future events
- **Scoring System**: Earn points based on difficulty and rebellion against collective wisdom
- **Hazard Levels**: Each level increases in moral complexity and stakes
- **Evolving Challenge**: The "God" becomes more intelligent and predictable as more data accumulates

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for the game interface
- **Data Collection**: Google Forms for player decisions
- **Data Processing**: Google Sheets API for probability calculations
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic probability adjustments based on collective memory
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages for global access
- **Mobile**: Responsive design for all devices

## Game Flow
1. **Level 1**: Start with the classic Trolley Problem (Low Hazard, Easy)
2. **Level 2**: Face the Lifeboat Dilemma (Medium Hazard, Medium)
3. **Level 3**: Navigate Hospital Triage (High Hazard, Hard)
4. **Level 4**: Confront the Nuclear Dilemma (Extreme Hazard, Very Hard)
5. **Level 5**: Make the Ultimate Choice (Maximum Hazard, Impossible)
6. **Final Score**: Get ranked based on total performance and rebellion against the "God"
