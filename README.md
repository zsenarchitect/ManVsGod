## Concept
A revolutionary chess game where **the rules themselves evolve** based on collective player behavior. You play as individual pieces against the collective wisdom of all previous players (the "God"), but your choices don't just affect the game - they change the fundamental rules of the game itself. This creates a meta-game where players actively shape the gaming experience through their strategic and moral decisions.

## Core Mechanics

### **üß¨ Dynamic Rules System**
- **Rule Evolution**: Game rules change based on collective player behavior
- **Player Influence**: Your choices directly impact rule modifications
- **Weekly Cycles**: Rules evolve on a weekly basis based on player patterns
- **Meta-Game**: Players can observe and influence rule changes in real-time

### **Chess Piece Perspective**
- **Level 1 (Tutorial)**: You are randomly assigned as a pawn at the beginning
- **Level 2-10**: You wake up as different pieces in mid-game positions
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level features more complex chess positions

### **Betting System**
- **Pre-Bet**: Before seeing God's move, you bet currency on your preferred move
- **God's Move**: The collective wisdom of previous players suggests a move
- **Decision Point**: 
  - If God's bet is higher than yours ‚Üí You must follow (unless you pay extra)
  - If your bet is higher ‚Üí You can choose your preferred move
- **Disobedience Cost**: Pay extra currency to ignore God's suggestion

### **Game Currency**
- **Starting Points**: Each player starts with limited game currency
- **Betting**: Use currency to express confidence in your moves
- **Survival**: Currency is spent on moves and disobedience
- **Game Over**: When captured or currency runs out

### **Collective Intelligence**
- **God's Move**: Based on previous players' choices in similar positions
- **Data Collection**: Your preferred moves become part of future God decisions
- **Evolving Strategy**: The collective wisdom improves with more players
- **Rule Shaping**: Your behavior patterns influence the evolution of game rules

- **Evolution**: The God becomes smarter as more data accumulates
- **Meta-Evolution**: The rules themselves evolve based on collective behavior
- **Democratic Gaming**: Players collectively shape the gaming experience
